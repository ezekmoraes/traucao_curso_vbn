00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,020
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash on that game it for the New

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:05,679
Boston

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,199
and this tutorial gonna be taking a look
at the do

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,859
until loop so now basically what to do
until it appears

5
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,858
is it similar to the for the in that it
will do a certain block of code

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,320
over and over again until a certain
value is reached

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,350
but the differences is that when you use
a for loop

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,289
the development knows exactly how many
times that for the is going to run

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,470
so let's say we did Fortnum one equals 1

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,808
to 20 we know that that's gonna go
twenty ties because we specified

11
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:40,119
that it needs to go that many times now
the do until loop

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,669
it will run and until

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,679
a certain value is reached and now
sometimes this around

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,780
unless it for example we make it due
into

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,789
I do until number one equals

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,750
10 is good run ten times or it could
write it thousand times

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,439
if no more in is equal to let's say

18
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,118
negative 990 there around a thousand
times

19
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,250
now let's go ahead and make a do until

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,478
example so go ahead and select a new
project

21
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,789
will do a console application and will
type

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,790
do until now it's humid here

23
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,969
okay that's go ahead and add console dot

24
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:35,400
redline so I won't forget that at the
end and now it's come up here

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,390
and will declare a variable sodium gnome
one

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,859
as integer and we'll set it equal to

27
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:48,049
negative well she said it was 0-2 start
with

28
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,780
a case in our what we're going to do

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,159
is we are are going to create are do
until

30
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,289
so tight do until numb one is equal to

31
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,000
let's do 10 and you can see here that
create this

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,550
loop word for us so basically what this
means is

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,640
is similar to the next in the for the 10
hits this day be right here

34
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,099
is good come back around to the top do
until then

35
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,620
and if num 1 is not equal to 10

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,759
that is gonna go ahead and keep looping
until them one is equal to 10

37
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,079
instead go down to the line after the
loop statement okay so what we want to

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
do and tell them what is it will attend

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,729
so decide consul to right line

40
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,639
no one now

41
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,229
if we run this the new we it will print
out

42
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,340
0 over and over and over again because
we have in committed

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,280
no more it's always going to be quite a
zero so it's just you

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,250
after concert outright line on one was
typed number one

45
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,330
place equals 1 so basically what this is
gonna do

46
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,769
is going to print out no boy this can
add one to it is your

47
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,420
is going to loop until number is
acquitted is gonna do counsel to

48
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,509
relied sega's if you read this

49
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:14,560
egos one 2345

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,849
6789 now you can see that it stops at
night

51
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:22,609
the reason it does is is because it does
it until then one Eagle said

52
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,790
so if num what is the quality and is not
going to do it now if we set the equal

53
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,409
to 11

54
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:33,539
that it would turn out all the way up to
10 now we can also a permit number one

55
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,620
in different values

56
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,620
so can you know my own place equals two
a conceive we run this week 02 4628

57
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,810
now can also set no mind to a different
value other than zero at the beginning

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,250
so be set equal to -20 if we go ahead
and do until numb one equals 10 is going

59
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,610
to do it

60
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,959
a different Amanda times says gonna
start native 20 -18 as

61
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,459
it committed by two all the way until he
gets to 8 so

62
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,930
go ahead and practice im a couple do 12
lives

63
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,300
I want you got those down you know
you're not gonna forget him go ahead and

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,569
move on to the next tutorial

65
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,599
and thanks for watching guys
