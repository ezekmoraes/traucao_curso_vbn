00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:05,650
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash on live gamer for the New

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,359
Boston

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,019
and this tutorial we can be taking
another look at the Select Case

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,169
statement so

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,279
this time instead of using integer we're
going to use

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,299
a string so we're gonna start off by
creating a string

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,618
sodium my string as string

8
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:28,809
said that you were nothing now we're
going to do is we're going to

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:34,850
get my stream from the user so is gonna
ask them

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,439
two interesting in my string

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,808
it's going to be equal to console die

12
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:48,369
read line and now we're going to do is
restart

13
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,750
are select case statement so select

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,469
case my string gonna do it case

15
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:02,948
hello and wish to console died

16
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:07,469
right line could buy

17
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,140
and will do two more cases for the case

18
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,140
could buy then cancelled outright line
hello

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,170
now in a new case I'm

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,090
message to you fishing

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,728
and the Yukon so died right line

22
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:44,819
boat okay so now if we run this

23
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,589
it going to close out right before

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,640
it's done so you had cancelled out
redline

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,368
now in summer I very first tutorials I
said that

26
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,700
this will let you read the line or the
the program before it closes out

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,549
and that is true but what he actually
really does

28
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,590
is that it waits for you to press enter

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,319
so whatever's you type in there in the
line that it's reading

30
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,319
it's going to you I'm move on to the
next eight min 20 press ENTER so

31
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,919
depressed nothing press Enter

32
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,280
then to go ahead and in our case exit
the program because there's nothing

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,090
after this

34
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,959
let's go and run this and if we type

35
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,599
fishing is gonna say boat we have one
problem

36
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,889
problem with this if we typed fishing

37
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,139
with a capital have it's not going to
give us anything

38
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,599
so what we need to do is make this
case-insensitive

39
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,549
so to do this which can type

40
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,640
my string died to

41
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,539
lower and

42
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:01,699
we need to make sure that all OVR
strings in terror cases are lower case

43
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,589
and you can see they are we at hello
goodbye and fishing and they're all

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,379
lower case

45
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,989
now we run this we can type

46
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,599
fishing in

47
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,659
anyway we want is going to give us both
back now what other thing we need to

48
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,259
cover

49
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:22,389
is what happened to the type in
something that's not a nice like a

50
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,798
statement such as

51
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,379
dark it's not to return anything so

52
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,409
to deal with this we're going to use
what's called

53
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,370
case Ellis and this is very similar to
the

54
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,379
else in the Italian statement is going
to cover anything that you don't have in

55
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:41,139
your cases

56
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,919
so if my sing that to lower is equal to
anything

57
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,929
other than hello goodbye or fishing

58
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,409
it's going go ahead and we'll have it
right

59
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:59,409
consul dot right line I don't know what
you're talking about

60
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,949
so now we run this we can type in
anything in here

61
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:16,000
an assay I don't know what you're
talking about so this is a very

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,920
fairly simple tutorial but the stuff
attaching this is very usefull

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,860
and I'm going back to some so I K
statements when you have that now down

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,379
to have it

65
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:27,159
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial and thanks for watching
