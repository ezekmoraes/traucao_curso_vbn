00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,980
hello youtube same here from YouTube dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,790
on life gamer for the New Boston
anticipatory ok we're going to be taking

3
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:09,388
a look

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,449
at the do while loop so basically what
to do while loop is

5
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,989
is its sounds very similar to do until
loop

6
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:20,778
but the concept of the is completely
opposite

7
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:24,480
now I mean by this is that the do until
you

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,518
will perform ace said code

9
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:31,809
until a value or until something is true

10
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,280
now the do while loop is completely
opposite

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,050
it will perform a block of code

12
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:43,409
while a value is true and that was that
value is false its gonna stop

13
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,839
so this go ahead and make a couple
demoss this

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,879
so go ahead and make a new project we
will call it

15
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:58,878
do while loop make sure you've selected
consul application

16
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:03,269
and go ahead and click okay

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,650
so does give their second to load here

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,780
assume in a bit

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,759
does go ahead and add

20
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,540
console dot redline so I don't forget to
retire on our program

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,729
announced come up right about that we're
going to create a variable

22
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:28,359
so we use the dim keyword was caught
number one

23
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,489
as integer and we'll set it equal to 0

24
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,709
us go ahead and make our do while loop

25
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:40,500
so we're Sarah by using the do keyword
which

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,828
the description says a pizza box
statement into a balloon

27
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,889
billion condition is true so now we're
going to add

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,290
while so repeats a blog statements while
able

29
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,670
boo the condition is true so do while

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,100
downwind is less than or equal to

31
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,269
15 now you can see that as the loop for
us so they're a loop back up to do while

32
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:04,899
statement

33
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,429
and after every iteration of the loop
you can see we did less than or equal to

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,310
15% in this

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,878
now if we just did lesson 15 did it
would trade out until I got to 14

36
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,000
and it would stop so we did at the equal
so

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,639
corporate all the way to fifteen so wish
to cancel

38
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,378
to right line no

39
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:31,899
1 okay so now we're going to take a
minute numb one

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,050
because we don't is just gonna run
forever so

41
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,360
will go ahead and you know I'm one plus
equals 1

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,670
now you can see that if we run this we
get

43
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:50,669
0 215 sweetness love you

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,210
I don't know why it's been doing this to
me lately but on this go ahead

45
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,990
and we'll take this table right here
number one place equals 1

46
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:11,020
well cut that out and they were at it
before our print statement or outright

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,230
lied statement so basically what it's
going to do is connect

48
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:17,799
at 12 noon first to name one first and
that is going to bring it out

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,680
so we're gonna start at the value wind
into all the way to

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,490
sixty now you may be wondering why is a
go to 16

51
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,810
well because in the last one we had no
one possible swine

52
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,110
after our costs a lot right line so it
was equal to 16

53
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,970
actually pointed out 15 ended up back to
top it said ok no its not less than

54
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:44,370
equal to 15 so it's going quite out of
this

55
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,390
okay

56
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,719
so if we do no more impossible's on
before

57
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,490
it will go to 16 and then it'll come
back up and say oh it's a lot less

58
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,040
illegal

59
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,129
15 let's go ahead and exit out here so
I'm

60
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:04,169
that was a quick tutorial on how to do

61
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,019
do while lives go ahead practice and do
I live some doing to loosen the tutorial

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,590
before this too what you got us down go
ahead and devices next tutorial

63
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,310
and thanks for watching
