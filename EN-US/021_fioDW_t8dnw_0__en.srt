00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,370
hello youtube same here from YouTube dot
com slash

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,179
on live gamer for the New Boston
editorial we're gonna be looking at a

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,089
couple of ways to format strings

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:14,968
so let's go and get started here is our
program

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:18,629
we have our main sad every gonna go
ahead and type in

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:24,839
so we're creative a book on my string
now or gonna do

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,920
is we're gonna prompt the user to

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,029
injury in a string so

9
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,939
console dot right line

10
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:38,890
please

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,890
enter a string now it's can get whatever
they entered in store as my string

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,920
now or going to do is we're going to ask
him for

13
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,579
a double value so cancelled outright lie

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,179
please

15
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:07,180
enter a decimal value now it's can get
whatever they typed in store it as a

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,530
double

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,269
so diem my double

18
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:18,349
as double is going to be equal to you

19
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:23,679
whatever they type in a case now or
gonna do

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,750
is reformatted strings so we're just
gonna

21
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,840
go ahead and U console dot right line to
give us some space

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,659
and now we're gonna format are stirring
incited arguments cancelled outright

23
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:36,210
line

24
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:43,209
so cancelled I right line we're gonna
start by typing the string key word

25
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,259
they were going to use a dot separator
to see what kinda methods there are

26
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,399
okay subs are available for us to use

27
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,450
for string so here's the format one that
we were using this as replaces one or

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:56,868
more

29
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:03,149
for madams is specified string with a
string representation a specified object

30
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,549
maybe we're using to %um you really have
to pay attention to that description

31
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:08,209
right now

32
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,479
let's go ahead and type format ever
gonna have to ask arguments for this

33
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,259
and first argument is going to be
enclosed in quotes

34
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,209
and this is where we're going to use to
tell Visual Basic how to format a string

35
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,530
so to start with a0 Colin in

36
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,840
to go enclose your braces there

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,920
and they're going to have a common and
after the comment will especially

38
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,659
specify which train to format it and

39
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,139
we're going to use my double so
basically what this does is it takes my

40
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,279
double formatting converted to a string

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,590
and you may be wondering what this means

42
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,979
well this means take any

43
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,449
take all at the numbers on the left side
the

44
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:57,869
the period and show them but only show
two spaces to the left side the period

45
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,939
so that had a really long a decimal
number

46
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:06,519
in only show the first two decimal
places now or gonna do

47
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,129
israeli I'm a show you a couple ways to
format a string so

48
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:16,620
was to console die right by and was
gonna take their strain which is my

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,280
string

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
ever gonna do dot to after

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,379
it's going to take their string thank
you for everything to uppercase

52
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,939
then we can also do cancelled outright
lied

53
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,609
my string dot to

54
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,860
lower and now if we chat con sadat
redline

55
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,200
to pass the program let's go ahead and
run this and see what happens

56
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,060
so its good assets for string

57
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,090
so the side on live gamer and what hath

58
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,469
assets for a decimal value soldiers type
really long decimal value

59
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,650
you can see that

60
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,450
it formats the decimal value to forty
3.23

61
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,039
it takes our string and covers all up to

62
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,609
uppercase and it takes a converted to
lowercase

63
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,000
are in the summer time to show you what
happens when we can personally to a

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,658
lower case

65
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:18,009
so enter in all caps chain

66
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:24,710
and winter a decimal value

67
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,129
and you can see that it formats our

68
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,300
decimal value in Atacama right here

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,220
just to make it look better so 2,342

70
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,800
that 23 and you can see here

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,168
that it took our string in Cumbria are
to uppercase

72
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:46,909
S's artie was a ver que si in you don't
see a change here

73
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,990
you can see that it takes it and covers
all to lower case

74
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,829
noses say few simple ways to format
strings and decimal numbers

75
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:59,959
and I have want you got that now down go
ahead and move on to the next door in

76
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,599
and thanks for watching
