00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,459
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:07,980
on live gamer for the New Boston in this
tutorial

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,169
we're going to be taking a look at
exiting a for loop

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:16,170
early now it's going to get started

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,760
will create a new project liked consul
application

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,410
and we'll just name it exit for Lou and
then click OK

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,550
now is wait for to our project and zoom
in a bit here

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,549
okay so now let's go ahead

9
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:40,839
and creator for versus type

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,129
cancelled outright lied immodest label
this one

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:52,128
as normal for loop now let's go ahead
and create

12
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,429
a simple for them so for no Moines

13
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:03,698
equals 1 to 30 let's go ahead

14
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:07,438
and printout num 1 so canceled our

15
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,529
right line no wine

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,849
so this is a very

17
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:17,169
fairly simple for the now she's at a
space here

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,840
so they're being empty line announced
tell them

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,290
that this is a for loop that is exited
went numb one is equal to a certain

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:26,859
value

21
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:33,859
so consul to right line for a loop

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:41,540
that exits before it's finished

23
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,459
so now it's great another for the so for
now I'm one

24
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,750
equals 1 230 let's go ahead and do
console dar

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,230
right line no

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,570
white okay so now we're gonna do

27
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,759
is we're going to test the value of Nome
wine

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,350
to see if it's equal or something and if
it is they were gonna go ahead and exit

29
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,879
before that so we gonna do this by using
a simple

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,079
a statement so if no Moines equals

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,560
23 then

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,640
what are we gonna do which can use the
keyword exit which is

33
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,329
exit procedure a block in chance for his
execution immediately to the statement

34
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,670
following the procedure call

35
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,759
or block definition so basically what
that means

36
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,609
is that if no more physical 23 is gonna
hit is

37
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,650
exit statement its gonna skip all the
way down to this I'm right here I'm

38
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,939
typing is coming

39
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,150
because that is

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,039
after the if statement and after the for
that so now if we go ahead and run this

41
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,780
see it closes their

42
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,209
go ahead and Yukon so I

43
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,468
redline

44
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:05,579
cases going to go to the top agencies as
normal for the

45
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,859
he says one two three four five and so
on

46
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,730
all the way down into it gets the value
30 announces

47
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,289
for the exits before it's finished it
started the value or in

48
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,590
he goes all the way down to the value 23
and

49
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,348
exits the former now we can also do this

50
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:29,699
if we step the value so for number one

51
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,128
Eagles 12 30 as we step by for

52
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:37,798
then you can see that

53
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,379
is this is Damon is never gonna rent so
if we run this

54
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:45,870
using its always 29 and it doesn't stop
at 24

55
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,819
so we can do is we can do if num 1

56
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:56,818
is a load here

57
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,909
okay so if num 1 is greater than 23

58
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:10,909
then exit the for loop see can see that
egos 159 1317

59
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,590
2125 and then exits for the

60
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,069
because now I'm one is greater than 23
so

61
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:22,459
go ahead and make a couple for loops
that exit

62
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,899
under certain condition in what you got
that down

63
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:29,589
in you remember it go ahead and move on
to the next tutorial so thanks for

64
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:29,909
