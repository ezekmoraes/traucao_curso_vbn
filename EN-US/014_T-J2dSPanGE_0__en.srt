00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:04,419
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:07,580
on I came in for the New Boston and this
tutorial

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,870
organ becoming the else if else
statement so the last 20

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:15,629
we covered the if statement now this go
ahead and get started

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,740
we're gonna start of by

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,169
using cancelled outright by and we'll
just type

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,310
what is your name

8
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:32,329
now we're going to create a variable

9
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:37,270
call username ever getting store the
information that a user types in

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,079
as username so declare using sodium

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,149
username as string

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,609
and what city equal to you consul dot
read

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:50,939
line now we want to do

14
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,329
is what I asked him for the password so

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,480
will just type cancelled I right mind

16
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,988
what is your password

17
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:06,170
and will declare the password

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,600
SODIMM password as string as

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,728
equal to you consul dot redline

20
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:18,000
okay so now we want to do is we want to
create an if statement

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,299
see if they typed in and name that is in
let's say

22
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,159
a list the possible names that can be

23
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,320
logged in so is username

24
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,758
equals same

25
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,310
or that same said that same same

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,469
dead do something so if username

27
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,368
is equal the same they will do console
died

28
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:52,368
right mind welcome same

29
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,759
now we want to cover any other cases
that could happen now I could do this

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,329
with a budget is statements that's not
very efficient

31
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:06,140
we can use what's called in else if
statement so

32
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,439
we just do this but having else's
username

33
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:16,009
equals Tim so views may be caused him

34
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,859
if we want to do something so

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,920
will decide console dodd right

36
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:29,919
line welcomed him

37
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:36,549
so basically basically what we've done
is if user name is equal to Sam

38
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,110
go ahead and say welcome same but if you
use an ABC quality and

39
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,099
it's a welcome Tim and this is all in
one a statement by using

40
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,419
else it in case somebody else tries to
log in and we don't know who they are

41
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,809
which can tell them that they have
tightening down name

42
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,890
now to do this we're gonna type

43
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,259
else so else

44
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,689
go ahead and do the code that is inside
in between else in India

45
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,169
what else does is it covers anything
else that you did not cover

46
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:10,298
so it is an equal say in this can go
ahead do this

47
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:14,769
but else if use in the people's ten you
know do this infusion Eagles

48
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,189
anything else other than to him or to
him the go-ahead

49
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,359
and do whatever we tied inside here
soldiers type consul

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,459
died right line you are not

51
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:33,459
a valid user added after in if

52
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,150
we'll just do consul dot redline

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,319
said so that the user has time to

54
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,818
see if they've been accepted receive
that have been the right name

55
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:47,379
so if we do what is your name night I
pinned Sam

56
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:52,039
just a what is your password are just
type in

57
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,888
the New Boston you know say welcome Sam

58
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:58,969
and then it won't say anything else
after that because we haven't added

59
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,930
anything that will handle the password
so now here and there again

60
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,379
your say what is your name what I did

61
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,650
10 or see

62
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,180
this is case sensitive so Tim

63
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,199
and say what is your password I've been
about stuff right there

64
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,029
says welcomed him now type anything else

65
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,719
other that same or 10 its gon say

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,030
you are not a valid user so we can do
the same thing

67
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:34,228
with our I'm password so

68
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:38,310
if password equals

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,598
the New Boston then

70
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:48,519
go ahead and let the user know that they
have been granted access

71
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,149
so will decide console dot

72
00:04:53,149 --> 00:05:00,149
right line and will say

73
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:07,399
congratz and then we'll just add their
usernames so

74
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,779
congratz username and they will say

75
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,568
you have been

76
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:23,460
granted access now

77
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:28,409
this is a very secure but is just for
the sake this tutorial I say

78
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,009
instead if you are not a valid user as
you say

79
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,538
I don't know who you are so that way

80
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:39,158
the person doesn't have to have the
right username but if they have the

81
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:42,959
I say the administrator password they
can go ahead and login

82
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,418
so I don't know who you are so we go
into this

83
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,448
say what is your name let's just say
same

84
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,038
what is your password typed in New
Boston

85
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,348
to say welcome Sam graduation same you
have been granted access

86
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:04,158
now all we need to do he is

87
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:08,180
as space right here so that Sam is right
next to that

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,500
so now if we type an invalid username

89
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,639
you know say should do this

90
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,389
in for type in the New Boston you see
that will

91
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,900
get out the I don't know you are you
know say congrat

92
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:29,769
a Dafa you have been granted access so

93
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,478
go ahead and practice some else if
statements and smell statements

94
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,629
get familiar with that and then once you
that no doubt go ahead and move on to

95
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:38,389
the next tutorial
