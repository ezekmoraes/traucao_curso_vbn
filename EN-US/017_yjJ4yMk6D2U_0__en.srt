00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,089
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,960
on life came in for the New Boston in
this tutorial we'll be taking a look at

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,269
logical operators

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,679
now basically a logical operators are is

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,219
that's a year using if statement so you
wanna do you

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,949
if this number is equal to a certain
value

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,340
or this number is equal to a different
value

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,448
the go ahead and do everything if
statement now

9
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,599
the or in that would be considered a
logical operator

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,380
you can also use the and operators so
let's say

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,380
if this number

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,790
is less than a certain value

13
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,649
and another number is less than a
certain value go ahead do whatever's in

14
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,170
Echo

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,000
so I'm let's go ahead and make a little
demo program for this

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,929
eyes could be similar to the log in one
third done before solace going to

17
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,439
stardom

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:58,320
we're gonna go ahead and declare our
username and password

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,079
sodium username as string

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,118
answer it with nothing in our gonna make
a password

21
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,170
so Tim password

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,349
as a stream we're going to set that
equal nothing to say just in case they

23
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:14,679
don't

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,990
type anything okay so now we're going to
do is going to prompt the user to enter

25
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:19,938
their username

26
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:25,258
soda right mind what

27
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,728
is your name now we want to do is worst
or their names of course

28
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:35,259
so username because time sold out
redline

29
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:41,478
now which can ask them for their
password so

30
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:48,478
will be cancelled outright by what is
your password

31
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:53,049
and with you

32
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:57,290
password equals console dot get mine

33
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,320
or die redline sorry okay so now that

34
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,688
with prompt the user to enter the name
and password we have stored both their

35
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,579
name in the password in variables

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,940
we want s those to see if we're going to
let the user in so we're going to start

37
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,489
off by creating an if statement

38
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,890
you type if username equals

39
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,409
same game go ahead

40
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,579
do this now or gonna do Israel at

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,180
in or operators who this now added or
operator

42
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,230
you gonna go ahead and just type the
keyword or

43
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:37,169
capital lower case are so if username
people seem

44
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,458
or username equals

45
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,830
10 now time 10

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,870
the go-ahead do this so let's go ahead
in print that out

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,459
so we can see what happens so cancelled
outright mind

48
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,580
hello anywhere just

49
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,659
add their username and they will go
ahead and cancel that read I'm

50
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:09,658
so we have time to read online before it
close okay to say what is your name

51
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,849
if I type in same ill say what is your
password I can't I do whatever I want

52
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:16,238
here

53
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,250
will say hello Sam now by type Tim

54
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,080
to say hello to him but about everything
else did nothing will show up

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,450
so now we want to do

56
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:29,548
is we won a test to see if the user name
is correct

57
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,750
or the password name it originated is
correct

58
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,318
and the password is correct so to do
this

59
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,348
missus go ahead and close this

60
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:42,759
in parentheses so this is going to be
its own separate

61
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,399
part the the if statement now this may
be a little confusing to you

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,530
but if you just go ahead practices after
this you understand it so

63
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,509
if his name because im or use an a
because team in the and operator is this

64
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:58,310
capital a

65
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,310
Indy you'll see that highlights to now
this is very simple

66
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,150
in other languages you got some symbols
for the and in or operator like the or

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,120
operator in C bus bus for example

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,860
will be that right there but in Visual
Basics is it sits at

69
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,889
a high-level language its the existing
this is very easy to

70
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,319
write code in the world best so if using
a beagle same

71
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,579
or username Eagles team and password

72
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:31,120
equals the New Boston

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,139
then we're gonna go ahead and tell them
that they have access by this

74
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,759
saying hello username basically what
this does is

75
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,110
is anything in here is true so

76
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,250
is this part issue and password it was
the New Boston issue so

77
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,470
if username people say missed you or use
any because Tim issue

78
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,540
in this whole part right here soon be
equal trip to true

79
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,479
and then and pass riegle's the New
Boston so this hope our last equal to

80
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,329
and password it was a new boston has
deport you

81
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:09,430
now this might be a little confusing to
you but I am just

82
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,620
this time try to figure out this again
if you have any questions in the comment

83
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,788
so if these Tuesday if these two
conditions are true:

84
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:21,149
the go ahead and let them in and ask go
ahead

85
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:27,329
and tied else will say cancelled
outright mine

86
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:31,990
access not granted

87
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,900
so if we run this program type what is
your name

88
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,859
bosses other say same you know type the
New Boston

89
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,060
it'll say hello Sam now scored once
again

90
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,310
and you can see their work with him to
you so

91
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,509
name is Tim password is the New Boston

92
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:55,110
you know say hello to him we've been
granted access

93
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,610
but anything is

94
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,270
not true so it's a we don't I P the same
or team so we tied

95
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,870
Joe and that which had to pass for the
New Boston

96
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,810
even though the password is correct is
gonna say access not going in

97
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,728
because to date has to be great it has
to be either Sam or Joe

98
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:18,068
and the password has to be good to the
New Boston

99
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,810
so on go ahead and practiced and make
some programs yourself with some

100
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,038
logical operators and once you've got a
logical operators now down

101
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,240
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorials and

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,780
thanks for watching
