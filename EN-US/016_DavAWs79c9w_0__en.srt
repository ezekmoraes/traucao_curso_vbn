00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,200
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,388
on my gamer for the New Boston in this
tutorial we'll be covering

3
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,709
conditional operators now basically
we're conditional operators are

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,630
is testing the sea if that value is
either less than

5
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:19,858
greater than less than or equal to

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,740
greater than or equal to or not equal to
you another value

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:28,209
so let's go ahead and get started we're
gonna go ahead and create a couple

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,170
variables appear

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,399
so will create a variable called

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,820
is in kindergarten as Billy

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,170
and was go ahead and said they could do
nothing now we're going to create

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,250
a couple other balloons and now the
reason we're doing this

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,890
is because we're gonna see and will use
the person's age determined

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,219
different things that they can and can't
do or

15
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,719
whether there at a certain point in
their life so

16
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,350
now gonna do Tim candid

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,250
drink as billion and you had said that
when he called I think to

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,750
and will diem and

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,950
is a or is senior citizen

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,950
as bullied

21
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,680
it was said that when he called nothing
to ok is now we're going to do

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,350
is going to prompt the user to put in
their name saw type

23
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:34,219
console dot right line or not their name
their age

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:39,900
what is your age now we're going to
create a new variable that stores your

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,400
age

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,579
sodium a jazz integer

27
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:46,629
ever said equal to consul to

28
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:49,688
redline so whatever they type in his
story in The

29
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:53,728
age variable so now we're going to
create some if statements here

30
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,140
so is

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,609
if

32
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:05,930
age does not equal 5 then do this

33
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,849
so basically that not equals operator

34
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:13,818
in Visual Basic is the less than sign
and the greater than sign

35
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:17,869
right next to each other now if you use
to any other languages

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,050
sometimes they were use the exclamation
mark

37
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,129
equals but in Visual Basic it's just
like that

38
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,359
so it age is not equal to 5% the week
we're gonna go ahead and set

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,970
is in kindergarten equal to false and
now

40
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,680
if it's anything else or if it is a
qualified

41
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,890
the is in kindergarten is equal to true
so now

42
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,469
we are going to create another statement
so

43
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,469
if age is greater than

44
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:54,060
or equal to 65 then

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,590
we're going to say that they are a
senior citizen so

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,598
is senior citizen equals

47
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,189
true and now at the age

48
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,628
is anything else that's not greater than
or equal to 65 which

49
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:14,378
pretty much set that's lower than 65
then

50
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:17,389
is senior citizen is going to be said
equal to you false

51
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,518
is an hour going to come down here below
that

52
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,530
and will make another

53
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,539
statement so if age

54
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:32,539
greater than or equal to you

55
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:36,139
21 then

56
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,169
can drink

57
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,369
is equal to you true

58
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,009
and

59
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,870
else can drink is equal to false

60
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,810
so now we're gonna do

61
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,259
is since we have all these if statements
made

62
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,250
to set the value to the balloons gonna
go ahead and create

63
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,019
a string so will do

64
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,590
damn outcome as

65
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:16,590
stream I'll go ahead and set the equal
to nothing or the issue

66
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:24,060
outcome kindergarten now is go ahead and
make a couple more these

67
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,120
and let's do

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,120
outcome senior

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,800
and outcome during

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,220
now are what we're gonna do is it age is
not a qualified

71
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,620
then outcome kindergarten

72
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,209
equals you aren't in

73
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:54,199
kindergarten

74
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,529
and that's just go ahead and copy this
right here

75
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:01,369
and if day are in kindergarten

76
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,250
which can tell them you are in
kindergarten now

77
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,620
outcome senior

78
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,840
equals you are a senior or citizen

79
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,199
your senior citizen and if they are

80
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,629
younger than 65 they were going to tell
them that they aren't

81
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,319
and now

82
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,339
outcome drink equals you

83
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:38,659
can drink because is greater than or
equal to 21

84
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,280
the Kendrick is equally true it's it's
Kendrick is a good true

85
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,219
they were going to say that they can do
it and now

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,450
else we're gonna say you cannot drink

87
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,959
now or gonna do

88
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,060
after all this is done we're going to
console

89
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,079
dot right mind outcome

90
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,009
drink and outcome

91
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,459
kindergarten and outcome

92
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:16,459
senior now is go ahead and add a couple
spaces in here

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,860
so outta space right there between as

94
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,920
just make are outcome with a little bit
nicer

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,920
so that their spaces in between each one
if the message is that we have here

96
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:37,959
okay so now if we run this hopefully
everything works I'm

97
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,998
if you type in what is your age okay
there we go we got a problem right there

98
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,349
I housing to do this in the program's

99
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:53,139
we're gonna have to add a consul that
remind okay

100
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,408
soon after we run this you say what is
your age

101
00:06:56,408 --> 00:07:00,149
in every type in five in say you cannot
drink you are in kindergarten

102
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,019
in the art a senior citizen and now if
we do something

103
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,740
like 21 say you can drink

104
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,879
you are dick in your garden and you are
a senior citizen and now it is one more

105
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,379
time

106
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,479
say what is your age will be sixty-seven
USA

107
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,248
you can drink you are in kindergarten
and you are a senior citizen

108
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:23,338
so make a couple programs

109
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:26,478
and using these conditional operators

110
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,550
they're very useful when using if
statement and it was you got that no

111
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,759
doubt go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial
