we take another look at strings

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:12,798
now E look to change the last tutorial
after the next

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,149
couple up coming to us we are asking a
look at some other stuff that you can do

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:16,839
with strings

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:21,028
so let's go ahead and get started now it
come up here

7
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,259
and we're going to declare a variable so
let's go ahead

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,880
and im username

9
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,769
as string now or gonna do

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,200
is real prompt the user to enter in
their username soldiers to cancelled

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,020
outright line

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,260
what is

13
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:48,628
your username now username

14
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:51,909
is going to be equal to you console dot

15
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:56,709
redline so basically just get with eight
active now we're gonna do

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,140
is a unit test to see if the user name
is a certainly so is gonna make it

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,119
simple is saving

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,759
so if username in our gonna do is win at
a

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,520
period so if use named I

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,899
and you can see here the intellisense
pops up with a whole buncha stuff that

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,530
we can do

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,820
and you can copy you can

23
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,899
dudack contains there's a whole bunch of
stuff that you can use

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,478
I'm with strings in this is very usefull

25
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:29,000
so or what we're going to use is

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,868
username dot Lee now he read a
description for this

27
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:35,938
is gonna say gets the number of
characters

28
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,679
in the current system dusting object so

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,270
if username dot linked equals

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,379
10 did go ahead and do something

31
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:50,879
soldiers to console dot right line

32
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,879
you have been granted access

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,640
now we're going to do is we're going to
add

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,840
cancelled out read 9 so that our program
will close at one word

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
now say was your username

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,959
if I type in so this in carriages on so
as to say one two three four five

37
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,670
6789 10 every prayer

38
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:28,829
press enter into say you have been
granted access now fleet I

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,010
anything else that's not equal to 10

40
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,099
so it's just easier the more than 10
it's not going to say anything

41
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,519
such as go back in here and at a simple

42
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,569
else know you do

43
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:49,569
is when a new console dot right line
your username

44
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:57,669
is not the right Lee

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,580
so now we run this you know say what is
your username

46
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,190
so we type something that's not 10
catches on it was a

47
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,710
your username is not the right lead now
we can also do it said abusing

48
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,409
if username dot link equals Ted we use
go ahead

49
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,810
in do if he is not username startling

50
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,640
dot equals inside the arguments for
equals

51
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,649
you know ask us for and object as
integer

52
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,520
so we'll go ahead and do 10 right there
this is just another way that you could

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,780
test the leaked value

54
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,120
views in a and I equals can be used for
a lot of others

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,659
other things in Visual Basic so if you
read this it should work so

56
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,030
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 a 9

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,150
10 you know say you have been great
granted access

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,810
now this is a really simple to simple
tutorial

59
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,590
annisten after practice it and go ahead
and stay tuned for the next tutorial and

60
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,229
exhorted
