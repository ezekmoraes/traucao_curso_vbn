00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:04,699
hello youtube same here from you dot com
slash

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,969
OnLive game it for the New Boston in
this tutorial we'll be taking a look

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,880
at quitting your do loops early dinosaur

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,059
for do while loops or do want to lose

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,539
now if you remember back we learned how
to quit

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,140
for loops early now the same concept can
be applied to you

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,839
do until I do while loops that's right
get started

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,019
and make a little devil application so
go ahead and slight console application

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,140
and will type this quitting

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,179
do loops

11
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,439
go ahead and click okay so it's humid
zone here

12
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,479
and ass go ahead and add

13
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,468
consul dot read line okay so now let's
create

14
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,910
our do and to so this to do

15
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,018
until Nam 1 equals

16
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,180
10 the go ahead and loop

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,799
those to appear and create now

18
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,049
one so

19
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:17,659
declared a blind as integer and we will
set it equal to see

20
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,570
so

21
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,758
I see well as you we're going to do
until one accosted

22
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,909
and wheel console dot right line no

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,299
1 now we're going to do

24
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,299
is we're going to in commit them one so
if you run this

25
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,379
it's going to give us your own two three
four five six seven eight nine

26
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,868
not sad a simple its statement so

27
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:57,438
if numb

28
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,789
wind equals 5

29
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,040
did exit

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,250
do so well is gonna do is

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,699
whenever it comes down actually are due
until statement each time it loops its

32
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,488
gonna hit this

33
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,969
if statement right here and then if
number one is equal to five then

34
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,539
exit do so system one such as you

35
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,439
is gonna run through this is can be fine
is can equal to 1

36
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,719
in Syria down and the one single spine
is an exit do

37
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,769
so our programs gonna put out 01 234

38
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,110
because is gonna exit was equal spy
let's go and read this

39
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,310
you can see here that we have zero one
two three four

40
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,650
now we can also do this

41
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,469
with a do while so do while

42
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:53,539
numb one is less than

43
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,199
or equal to 10 so

44
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,598
if number one is equal to 5% did exit

45
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,449
the do it's going to change it will be
here with you is number one is equal to

46
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:05,969
7%

47
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,759
so you can see here that we get zero

48
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,870
one 23 456 and then it exits

49
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,230
now we can also do

50
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,329
is let's say our do while loop is

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,069
not incrementing by one so what if it
skips the number five well what we can

52
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,048
do it said Oh

53
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,299
is number one equals five we can do if
someone

54
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,640
is greater than by so season commit this
by

55
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,949
to you can see here that we're gonna get

56
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:40,509
0 to for and now

57
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,620
you can see that stopped before it got
to fight because number one was verified

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,158
now if we do it like this then it's
gonna free now all the way

59
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:54,128
in this if statement is never gonna run
so go ahead

60
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:57,229
and make a couple doing two loops that

61
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,919
exit based on certain conditions you can
do it differently than I did

62
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,829
I encourage you to do that so you can
learn more about the programming

63
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,299
and then once you've got that down go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial

64
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,129
and thanks for watching
