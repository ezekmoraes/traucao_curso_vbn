00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,108
hello youtube same here from YouTube dot
com slash on live gamer for the New

2
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:06,790
Boston

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,800
and this tutorial we'll be taking a look
at comparing strings

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,450
says go and get started we're gonna come
down here

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,608
under our main cell and we're going to
create a couple variables

6
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:21,660
we'll start off by creating a string

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,679
so we'll just call it users stream

8
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,678
as string elsa equal to nothing

9
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,759
and they will declare another string
computer string

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,030
as string they will set that one equal
to

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,750
on live gamer now or gonna do

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,609
is we're going to prompt the user to
enter in a string so

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,479
console dot right line please

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:59,479
enter a stream so there was shelling get
what they type in

15
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,118
said that we have with it acted we're
going to use the string doc compare

16
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:11,760
function

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,780
so we're gonna console dot right wine

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,390
and which can it typed

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,649
string dot compare every reply going to
compare

20
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:28,859
user string to

21
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,030
computer string so that is our two

22
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,820
arguments for our string to compare the
first one

23
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:41,489
is the showing that where going to ca
that we're going to compare to the first

24
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,009
ring

25
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:46,090
so here if you understand what that
means

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,689
a good show you so they will do console
to reason I'd

27
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:55,890
now we run this you can see that I type

28
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,250
on live gamer

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,000
it had s is going to give me the value
of one

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,329
because it is comparing destroying to

31
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,340
the second-string now if we replace
these

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,989
input it backwards

33
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:20,989
we're going to get a value have -1

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,650
you can see out there that gives us -1
because instead of comparing the string

35
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,549
that they gave us

36
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,950
to the first ring were comparing the
first string to string that they gave us

37
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:37,169
there might be a little confusing but
I'm you can mess around

38
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,250
if you want and now we can also make
this

39
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,930
case insensitive so even if they make
the whole thing in capital letters

40
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,230
comparing it to this right here is going
to give us

41
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:53,798
a value of $0 so all she had to do this

42
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,650
which can type use a string and we're
going to compare that to computer string

43
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,379
in for a third argument it's got ignore
case

44
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:05,739
as boolean right here which can attack
true

45
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,780
so that I can type it anywhere they want
they can type it

46
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,049
all caps all lower case they can switch
off between cap similar case

47
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,290
whatever they want to do and I it %uh
still

48
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:21,719
give us a correct value so

49
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:28,719
if I type quite a bit like this

50
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,960
is going to give us a value of $0
because it compares a case-insensitive

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,230
and it just checked to see if these are
the same

52
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:44,289
as on live gamer so

53
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,400
that was a pretty simple tutorial you
can use this

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,620
for a bunch of different things in your
programs

55
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,259
and go ahead clear out the I get used to
it and what you don't that

56
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,139
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial
