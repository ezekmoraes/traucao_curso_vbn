00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,649
hello youtube and welcome to your fourth

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:07,290
microsoft visual basic tutorial in this
tutorial we can actually start

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,028
programming

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:11,820
now to start of we're gonna go ahead and
click new project

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,609
and this will open up our new project

6
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:19,948
window now here you have to try to get
this in the frame

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,960
we're gonna go ahead and use it started
place and Visual Basic in a select a

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,580
console application

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,209
now to do with this one's applications
that has a little a lot occurred at

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,590
are already pre made for you and this
could confuse you even more

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,020
if you're a beginner program and you've
never going to language so I'm

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,609
I was going to go ahead and name this
wide VB

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,659
hello world and now

14
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:50,519
go ahead and click okay and start
loading

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,920
our project here's a module that we
created

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,120
they could see inside our module it
starts with module module one

17
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,390
that's the name of the file and it
started and

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,448
into the in module that everything going
to make

19
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,929
is gonna have to start with the type
that is

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,080
like a class is a class MyClass as
always it had to end with

21
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,170
in Dubai class and for instance years
are

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,509
main so here said main

23
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,540
and ends with inset now and I said

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,380
class MyClass in my class AB class
MyClass

25
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,750
the and class so I screwed up a bit but
a

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,250
going to start in every program

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,310
there has to be what's called a made sub

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,079
now what this does is it's the first
step that runs no matter what

29
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,419
the program has to have a starting point
you can still create about two sides and

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,239
running expected to know what to do it
won't know what to do

31
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,459
so you have to create meter this case it
has been created for us

32
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:55,438
so let's go ahead and start typing code
inside

33
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,919
so we can start by typing console they
can see that there's a window that pops

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,590
up right here

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,399
now it has about a where is it here that
you may or may not know what they do

36
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,500
now with this is called is his car into
Houston's

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,520
is what most helpful things that has
built a GUID

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,500
the looks at what you party written
gives suggestions based on that

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,039
so you can see here that the first one
is consul

40
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,539
which is what we want so what's next
type consul dot

41
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,579
they will do right acres here there is
that right can write my

42
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,969
was a row down and so it's right by
press tab

43
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,689
are back in style boris now

44
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,430
week alright my this is a said and

45
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,709
inside it inside at these for this is
right here

46
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,539
is what's called arguments now the
arguments for writing allied to the

47
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,189
console

48
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:53,439
is a string what a string is is it's a
budget characters put together

49
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,189
they're stored inside a have to

50
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:03,090
quotation marks so this type hello world
now this is our hello world string

51
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,170
it is not stored as a variable or a data
type

52
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:11,479
it's just there's for the time when the
in its gone now

53
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,658
it something just discard a literal
string

54
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:18,750
I don't know if it's the same Visual
Basic have that but I apps could cause a

55
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,340
little strip

56
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,810
a literal string because the same thing
so

57
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,810
down below that we're gonna have to do
is type consoles

58
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,530
dot read line and will leave

59
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,370
empty arguments for that because we
don't have to tell it to do anything

60
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,009
specific

61
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,039
now we come up here

62
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,818
you can see the start debugging hairy a
row but this does

63
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:45,439
is a it runs a program and debug mode

64
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,430
which will show us the air stand air
this so you can

65
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,780
clicked this or you can just press a 5

66
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,049
they can see that is star save a console
window

67
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,349
or a cmd window if that's too that's
what you might call it

68
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:04,389
and it says hello world you can see that
it stopped right here it is

69
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,458
stopping to let us read the line that's
why we called consul top Rehbein

70
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,280
now if we take out this line of code

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,370
and run it yes the

72
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,870
the window is going to pop up in a
disappearing fast

73
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,810
you know that over time

74
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,089
so

75
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:31,779
in order for us to be able to see what's
actually going on before close

76
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:38,000
gonna have to do canceled at redline we
run this

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,269
you CSS hello world so congratulations
guys you've successfully created your

78
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,859
first hello world program

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,139
and I stay tuned for the next tutorial
