a box right here called my numbers make
sure that is checked

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,400
now what we wanted why we want to check
this is so that later on we're making

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,140
our programs

56
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,399
if we weren't airs the airless is gonna
tell us what line number that's on

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,920
is be very useful to be able to see the
line numbers right next year code

is so the most commonly use controls now
we also have

79
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,899
the a realist which also are there is no
programs also the warnings

80
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,109
what a warning is is it really it really
isn't air

81
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,990
but it's something that could cause air
when you run your program

82
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,340
and over here we have our solution
explorer which I

83
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:59,969
basically we're solution is is it to
file they can hold a budget projects

84
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,520
or one project if you'd like inside the
Stratus you have classes
