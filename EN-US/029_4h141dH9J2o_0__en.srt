00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,250
hello youtube same here from youtube.com
size on live gamer for the New Boston

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,189
and St George we're gonna be taking work
at the continue statement

3
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,048
now what this does is let's say you
making for the

4
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,278
and it's for GNOME one equals 1 230

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,640
now let's say if no more days ago 23

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,420
in you don't want it to run that
iteration of the for the

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,929
so it will print out assay would have
cancelled outright

8
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:31,660
I know one and you don't want 23 to
print out

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,130
you would use if number one equals 23

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,359
then continue for so basically what that
does is it

11
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,539
skips that iteration the for loop moves
on to the next one

12
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:46,929
so I let's go ahead and make some
examples of this so what type cancelled

13
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:47,960
outright lied

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,960
normal for the it will make up for the

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,129
Asus 215 you cancelled I

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,560
right line nom

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,969
1 so basically where this is going to do
is just gonna write out 13 15

18
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:19,969
on our consul now it's at a space here

19
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:25,579
and ice to you

20
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,789
continue statement a case and asked
maker for the

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,719
that has the continue statement it so to
start off by using the four key word

22
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,349
will create a random one variable and
we'll go to 15

23
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:45,409
that number one can only be accessed
inside this for the

24
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:51,039
and nowhere else because we didn't
actually declared says go ahead

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,250
and type a simple if statement so

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,040
if number one is

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,330
equal to 5 then what we want to do

28
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,549
was typed continue for

29
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,219
so this is going to do is is gonna skip
the iteration

30
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,319
no more if numb 105 its gonna skip
whatever code comes after this

31
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,129
now his here's a check that I wanna
teach you guys in the city were

32
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,240
if you haven't if statement with only
one might have

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,460
might occur in between in India you can
just go ahead and take out India

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,629
in do this instead so

35
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,530
if num 1 equals five dead continue

36
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,840
for by doing this you don't have to have

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
the in if statement and your code is a
lot and neater

38
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,300
and easier to read so

39
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,430
now that we have a if statement and with
just you console

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,200
da right line no

41
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,979
1 so if we go and run this

42
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,250
we're going to get

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,900
in our normal for the it says one

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,590
2345 6789 10

45
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,400
11 12 13 14 15 you can see that all the
numbers are there

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,450
benefit cannot hear the car continues
David

47
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,439
you can see it looks like other numbers
there but we're missing a five-minute in

48
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,359
between for

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,620
and six now

50
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,489
let's do this for a couple other values
so let's go ahead

51
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,170
and create a multiplied if statement so

52
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:38,629
if no money aside then continue 4 that's
just sad

53
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,959
and or operator so

54
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,819
if someone Eagles 5 or no more in is
equal to you

55
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,858
8 or numb one is

56
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,530
equal to you let's say 12 so

57
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,870
we can really have to make that will
delight will just go ahead and put this

58
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,780
right after that

59
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,069
okay said I was gonna do

60
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:09,129
is gonna skip to number five 8 in 12 so
if we run this

61
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,789
we're going to get 12 346

62
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,849
7 its gonna skip a is easy if I

63
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:21,689
any of the skipped 12 so go ahead

64
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,819
and practice some continue for statement
you can

65
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,060
come up with different ways to use it
within your program and I want you know

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,399
how to do that United forget it

67
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,519
the go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial
