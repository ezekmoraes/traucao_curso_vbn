00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,040
hello you do and welcome to your first
microsoft visual basic tutorial

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,300
editorial I'm gonna be introducing
myself letting us know what a

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,280
programming language is probably
beginners out there who are just looking

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,279
to learn a language

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,678
let you know that about about the dotnet
framework and

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,679
about what we're gonna be doing in these
tutorials now that's good you started

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,608
my name is Sam and I run the YouTube
channel YouTube dot com slash

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,930
on my came in I'm currently have about
80 videos

9
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:30,469
and they're over Visual Basic Java

10
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:34,429
visual c plus plus and C sharp so you
can go ahead and go check that out if

11
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:34,939
you want

12
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:38,210
how they make a lot more césar videos

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,590
in the future so you want to go and
subscribe

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,469
and another man advertised his over what
is

15
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,539
a programming language what a
programming language does

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,640
is aid uses code that the

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,410
developer rights and it makes the
decision what I mean by this

18
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:58,509
is that it can solve a problem make a
decision

19
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:02,039
for the user and to do this it uses

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,349
data and algorithms all programming
language use data and algorithms

21
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:09,408
it takes that data push it through an
algorithm

22
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,010
and did you get it output so now that
you know a little bit about

23
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,460
what any programming languages but I
signed you what the dotnet framework is

24
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:22,809
now the dotnet framework was a made by
Microsoft

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,189
and a what they wanted to do

26
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:29,649
what they wanted to create a programming
language or not language don't agree

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,210
a framework that was independent the
Windows

28
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,618
and what I mean by this is that when you
create a program that runs on the dotnet

29
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:37,319
framework

30
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,639
it is not dependent on the system it
runs

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,868
on the framework itself which is kind of
like a virtual machine if you've ever

32
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:45,319
used

33
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,438
used a virtual machine or a free Java
programmers

34
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,529
it's like the Java Virtual Machine he
keeps independent have the computer that

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,280
is running on

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,649
but in my opinion is a lot more
effective in the Java Virtual Machine

37
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,280
in as a lot better job now I'm may vary
to this but

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,640
Visual Basic is a very high level
language what I mean by this is that

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,150
is easy to understand is very much like
English

40
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,700
and is when the highest program highest
level languages that

41
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,318
I know and an example the low-level
language would be

42
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,219
c plus plus or something similar that
now I am

43
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,530
what we gonna be doing this tutorial
well

44
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,300
will not listen to all the tutorials
will start off by covering

45
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,439
data types variables were gonna do some
math

46
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,259
we're gonna work on I'm simple steps to
begin with Justin the Consul

47
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,579
in there were gonna move on to Windows
Forms now this is one of the things I

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,910
love about Visual Basic

49
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,939
is that its easy to make windows in and
Mike

50
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:50,009
and c plus plus or Python or

51
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,399
other problem there's a job there you
don't have to use the code to make your

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,590
Windows in

53
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,110
the Visual Basic I D E you can just drag
and drop objects on the winners

54
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,909
and the I D E will automatically
generate code for you

55
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:09,079
that creates that window so that when
you run the program

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,680
it looks exactly like you want and now
if you do it by yourself such as the

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,790
language like Java

58
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,120
sometimes it's hard to see to visualize
what you wind is going to look like

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,599
by just by typing the conies important
so this is one the reasons I like Visual

60
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:24,158
Basic

61
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,139
and all the visual are going which is in
Visual Studio

62
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,219
so I'm you guys have any questions

63
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,870
in guiding them in the comments I I'll
be monitoring

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,250
these videos on the New Boston and I'm
I'll try to answer as many questions as

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,848
I can I know they're going to be a lot

66
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:44,810
as he has a lot to subscribers and have
your stay tuned

67
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,989
for the next tutorial also

68
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,459
one more thing is that you guys will
learn more about

69
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,830
the languages in that run on the dotnet
framework or just other stuff

70
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,830
about development with this you can go
ahead and head over to the

71
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,110
Microsoft developers website at
investing in da Microsoft com

72
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,909
to read up about their languages they
have and I'm

73
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:13,429
the new stuff and the new releases that
they come out with so I'll

74
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,590
that's about it thanks for watching and
don't forget to comment like and
