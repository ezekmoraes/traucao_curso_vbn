00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,660
hello to you too same here from YouTube
dot com slash

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,919
on live gamer for the New Boston and in
this tutorial

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,570
we're going to be using some of the
things that you've learned in the last

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,339
tutorial

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,388
to make a simple calculator program says
go ahead and get started

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,480
we go ahead and kisses FaceTime herein
are made said

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,990
ever going to prompt the user to input a
value so use consul

8
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:28,518
dot right mind please

9
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:35,369
inter the first number now what we're
going to do

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,399
is we're going to declare a variable and
we use

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,799
canceled at redline to store the
information in that variable

12
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,849
so is that the did keyword so

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,899
damn number one as

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,579
double and woody said equal to you

15
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,640
console dot read line

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,948
so if you want to read a value from the
line

17
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:03,659
or if you want to get the input to the
user's putting in you can declare the

18
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:04,399
variable

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,359
inside to conserve battery died at the
same time you can do all this the one

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,670
mine which saves you some

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,099
coating time so now we have a first
number

22
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,129
we're gonna do use consul

23
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,920
die right mind I was gonna tell the user

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,689
what that person a breeze they know that
the program received it correctly

25
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:31,709
so do first member

26
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,839
in which issues the inside

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,710
and will print out no one now or gonna
do is really prompted to enter a second

28
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,259
number

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,310
so we will use consul

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,109
dot right mind please

31
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:58,109
into the second number

32
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:04,599
now we're going to create another
variable so we will use it in keyword

33
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,079
will do diem no to as

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,730
double and we'll set it equal to you

35
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,939
console dot redline so this does the
same thing that we did up here

36
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,659
in declaring number one and we use
concert I read 9

37
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,150
in itself the more that you were going
with them to you okay

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,159
so now we're going to print out the
answer the first woman tell them

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,530
that we receive their first
democratically so

40
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,650
cancelled outright line second number

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,170
now we're going to create

42
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:47,250
a third variable with we will delete

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,759
and will type answer as the name

44
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,549
we want to make it a double and we'll
set it equal to

45
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,020
number one times

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,710
no to you now is gonna print that out

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,000
so console dot right mind

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,099
answer

49
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,400
also the equal to answer

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,409
over at answer to that and we do use the

51
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,219
and sign right here now who run this
program

52
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,889
you know say please enter the first
number

53
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:30,269
supply type: 32 press ENTER its gonna
tell me the first number is 32

54
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,020
is going to ask before the second number
so as to forty-five

55
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,739
NEC close on its right there

56
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,300
so we need to add consul dot redline

57
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,989
okay so into the first number

58
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,219
34 he says person under 34

59
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,129
and well into the second number 45 we
present a real tell us the second number

60
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,709
you know tell us the answer so that's
good to hear

61
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,319
and less just specify what the
calculated

62
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,370
so do the numbers multiplied

63
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,450
is is going to give us the answer now
what we can do to save time

64
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,608
is we can get rid of answer all by
itself

65
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,738
instead of putting up pretty out the
answer

66
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,089
we can do number one times

67
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,719
dime to so what this does

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,830
is it takes an armored about the prized
by them to only does that

69
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:34,479
arguments of counsel that right nine so
is nice or as a variable

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,889
it is going to print out that number and
is not going to save anywhere

71
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,769
now you can choose which one you want to
do if you want to use answer later on

72
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:44,769
then I would suggest declaring that
variable

73
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,949
and storing in there because if you want
to answer later on

74
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,779
and you didn't declare a variable for it
you will be able to get the answer

75
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:52,250
because

76
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,620
the only time that you have the answer
printed out the screen or stored

77
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,209
anywhere

78
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,638
is with you writes this line and
multiply them together

79
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,069
so you had play around the

80
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,550
you can make it not by you can make a
divide you can make your ad

81
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,960
whenever you want and what you've got
and no doubt move on to the next
