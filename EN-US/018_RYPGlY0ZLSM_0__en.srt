on live gamer for the New Boston ends
2/2

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,939
will be taking a look at what's called
concatenating strings

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,209
basically what this means is taking one
string

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,250
in adding another string to a and

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,028
when you do this is stored in another
variable says going to get started

7
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,948
we're going to create concatenate demo
so go ahead

8
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,849
got a new project we will name this

9
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,009
string concatenate and they will go
ahead and click

10
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,609
okay make sure you have selected a

11
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,628
consul application now here is my jewel
1

12
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:49,039
let's go ahead and zoom in here a bit
okay so now we're going to do

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,829
is we are going to create a string so

14
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,910
diem users sharing as stream

15
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,869
it will go ahead and said that you could
do nothing because we can have then type

16
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:00,299
in

17
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,608
a string now or gonna do

18
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,019
is we're going to create another string
that will be stored in our program

19
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,759
so im programs during

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,430
as stream and order said that it was
something right I'm

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,060
catfish now or gonna do

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,019
is real prompt the user to enter
industry so the console

23
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:32,938
dot right line type anything you want

24
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,008
so now we're going to do

25
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,700
is really get with a tight so users tree
equals

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,700
console dot redline now what we're gonna
do

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,000
is we're going to take their users chain
and add programs trying to it

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,228
so but first we're gonna print out with
a tight

29
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,658
so can so that right line users chain

30
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,289
an hour into Israel had programs chain
to it so

31
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:12,659
users chain equals

32
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,848
is chain plus

33
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,500
programs tree so basically what this
does

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,620
is it takes users chain in as program
shame to it

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,620
and makes all one word that's good

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,659
not one word one stream so it's good at
it a space in catfish so it will you

37
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,109
will be able to see the space in there

38
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,550
in or going to you is run a printout
users change

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,550
again and a modest

40
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,709
have the program pas away first to press
Enter

41
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,159

47
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,019
is we can come back in here and we can
add

48
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,959

what they typed

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,400
at catfish the add fishing now we can
also use this which is what we've used

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,709
in several other tutorials we can use
the ensign

55
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,479
inside a concert outright 9 statement to
add another string to it

56
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,548
so decide hello YouTube what this does

57
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,299
is it takes you string and as hell
YouTube to it for the time being

58
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,849
and then it doesn't save had hella
YouTube it's just there when this class

59
00:03:57,848 --> 00:03:59,048
is not right on his car

60
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,959
and it disappears so let's go ahead and
run this

61
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,810
now to say type anything you want

talks about right line

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,199
this is going to be discarded as soon as
you're done with this statement or since

69
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,050
the programs that this statement
