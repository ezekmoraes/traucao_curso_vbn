00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,480
hello youtube same here from YouTube dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,730
on I came in for the New Boston in this
tutorial

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,750
we're gonna be taking a look at nested
if statements now the last tutorial we

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,308
covered

5
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:16,198
else if statements and else it now if
you don't know if they've been is I

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,550
would suggest you move our backs on
about early

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,640
earlier tutorials and learn from that

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,920
no and what you know if statement is go
ahead and move on to this tutorial

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,699
so basically what a nested if statement
is

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,890
is that you take one if statement it you
put another if statement cited this

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,670
and what that does is it makes it where
both values have to be true

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,129
for the condition for the program inside
the in a loop

13
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,799
to run so I let's go ahead and create

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,099
a little example this so you go ahead

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,480
and declare a variable and this variable
is going to be there age

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,000
sodium age as integer

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,230
and we'll set it equal than nothing so
just in case they don't type anything we

18
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:01,689
wanted

19
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:05,378
air we try to print out there age now
we're going to

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,829
create insurance so in new DM

21
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,569
has insurance as

22
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:17,849
bully ever you go ahead and said that he
courted nothing

23
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,539
to so now we're going to do

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,540
is green asked him what the ages so do
console

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,290
to right line what is

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,140
your age now which you can set the

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,560
vary by age to whatever they type in so

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,259
age equals console da redline now we're
gonna ask him

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,609
if they have insurance so will do

30
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:53,609
consul dot right by do you have
insurance

31
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,618
true

32
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,390
or false and will do

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,460
has insurance equals console dot

34
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,228
read line now this will not work if that
had anything other than sure foss

35
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,170
your program will get an area and it
will crash this is just for the sake of

36
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:14,988
it it over

37
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:20,270
tutorial now we're going to create our
if statement so

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,860
is age equals

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,030
16 did we want do whatever is inside
this

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,209
statement now we're gonna create and his
team inside this which is called the

41
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,560
nested if statement so if has

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,650
insurance equals

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,870
true there we want to do the code inside
this

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,469
will just type console dot right line

45
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:54,409
you can drive

46
00:02:54,409 --> 00:03:01,240
legally

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,530
now or gonna do is weakening cover the
case

48
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,180
them not have insurance so we're just
gonna go ahead and tight

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,990
else so if age is equal to 16 it has
insurance is equal to false

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,530
because the only other option we have
for has insurance is false

51
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,530
we're gonna type consul dot right mind

52
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,318
you can drive but don't get pulled over

53
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:38,318
or you are screwed

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,570
okay so now we run this its gonna go
ahead and say

55
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,680
what is your age so what type in 16

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,510
and say do you have insurance true or
false suffice it true

57
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:55,889
its gonna say you can drive don't is a

58
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,139
in say you can drive legally they can
see that it closed out

59
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,699
right after we did that soldiers console
that read by

60
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,869
say gives us time to read that before we
can close the program

61
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,039
and say what is your age

62
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,079
sauce a sixteen and I do have insurance

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,720
so to say you can drive legally now

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,970
if I type in 16 for age

65
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,940
and false for do you have insurance

66
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,939
say you can drive for don't get pulled
over or you're screwed

67
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,699
and now at my age

68
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,000
is not equal to 16 let's say 12

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,300
yes I do you have insurance you are
false

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,790
I say fast it's not going to say
anything because

71
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,370
the first value was not you so it won't
move on to the next yr

72
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,418
inside the nested loop so what we're
gonna do

73
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,870
Israel had a simple else right here so

74
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,509
if ages ago 16 the do the stuff in here
and else

75
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,699
cancelled I right line you cannot drive

76
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:10,219
would happen twelve-year

77
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,460
in type in all

78
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,478
you know say you cannot try now

79
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,740
there is a better way to do this by
using what's called

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,090
conditional operators and logical
operators

81
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,839
I wanted you guys I wanted to teach you
guys have to make nested

82
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,899
if statements and unacceptable tutorials

83
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,489
we'll be learning conditional operators
and the use for this is that

84
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,449
age has to be equal to 16 and if there
are any older than 16

85
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,829
did it won't work so I said 21 they can
legally drive

86
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:50,430
but it says you cannot drive so the way
to get around this is to use

87
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,680
conditional operators so

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,168
makes unless it is statements and keys
to them

89
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,038
and what you've got is now that go ahead
move on to the next tutorial
