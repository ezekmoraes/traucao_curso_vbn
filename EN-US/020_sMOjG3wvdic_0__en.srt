00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,789
hello youtube Sam hear from you to dot
com slash on live gamer for the New

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,509
Boston

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,630
editorial we're gonna be taking a look
at substrings

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,509
basically we're substring is is
extracting

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,760
part of a string a certain amount of
characters from a string

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,850
so let's go and you started and make a
little demo for this

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,519
so here's our main cell or gonna go
ahead and do is create a variable

8
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,118
so we'll just make this use a string as
string

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,399
and we'll see nothing an hour gonna do

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,460
is we're going to prompt the user to
into industry so console

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,359
die right line enter a

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,750
strain now or going to lose weight and
get their string

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,750
you should be very familiar with this
okay so now we're going to do is win a

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,649
print out the link that string

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,179
so for Southwest just at some space here

16
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,400
so that will create an empty line and
they will see

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,219
what the program pappas anne Taintor
line just so easy to read inside a

18
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,478
barred console window

19
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:15,810
now or gonna do israeli consul to

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,950
right line use a string

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,689
dot link image go ahead and convert that
to a string

22
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:30,389
so basically what we've done is we've
printed out

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,310
you for sharing that link was gets a
link to the string which went ahead and

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,609
compare that to a string

25
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,540
and left empty parameters right here so
now

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,130
we're going to you get some substrings a
use a string

27
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,109
so which is going to you cancelled
outright line

28
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:50,799
ever gonna do

29
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,130
use a string dots substring

30
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,670
inside of our parameters

31
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,769
we're going to have to arguments you
know have the start index

32
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:08,008
we're going to have the wing so we're
just gonna start

33
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,259
at zero and will print out the first 3
characters

34
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,399
this string so whenever you working with
the substring

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,510
strings always start at zero so let's
say you have

36
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:25,098
a use a string and you get the link to
that whenever you're counting to that

37
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,409
link is gonna start as you're so the
latest 12

38
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,750
is gonna go from 0 to 11 because as
twelve and values

39
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,330
but they always start 0 so they will
just go ahead

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,330
and do this a couple more times the dot

41
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:47,318
substring and will start at three

42
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:54,318
and we'll go ahead three characters and
then we're gonna do

43
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,419
is we're going to do this one more time
you but we're going to do a little bit

44
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,009
differently

45
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:05,658
be so instead abusing

46
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:10,049
to arguments for the prime matters at
the substring which can go ahead

47
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,659
and you use a string dot substring

48
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,959
so what this is gonna do

49
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,810
is gonna print out the first 3
characters at use a string

50
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,060
this gonna print out the third 26
characters abuse a string

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,580
Indian is gonna print out the remaining
characters abusers doing

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,549
so if we go ahead and run this is going
to say

53
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,730
interesting so we'll just type

54
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,209
on life came in and they were the same

55
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,319
so and once again we get that

56
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,979
air that I always run into ok it's such
a nice again

57
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,119
soldiers type on life

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,469
gamer same and you can see that

59
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,759
it tells us that the link that on that
MSM is 14

60
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,848
and its gonna tell us that the first 3
characters

61
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:08,109
at this string I here's is onal the next
the characters

62
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,530
is I V E and in the remaining characters

63
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,519
is gamer Sam so go ahead

64
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,978
and you can pat is a little bit with
substrings and then once you get that

65
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:19,709
now down

66
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,100
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial
