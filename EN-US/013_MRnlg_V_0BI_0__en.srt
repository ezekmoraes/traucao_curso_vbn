00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,439
hello youtube same here from YouTube dot
com slash

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,819
OnLive gaming for the New Boston and
this tutorial

3
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:11,330
we're gonna be wearing the if statement
now the if statement

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,660
is one of the most useful tools for
beginners

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,859
in Visual Basic because there's so much
that you could do with it

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,230
is very easy to pick up is very
intuitive says go ahead get started

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,460
the first up we are going to make a
program

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,910
that we're asking users for their
username and password

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,609
this may be a little bit different than
what you'd expect for a username

10
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,058
password login to be

11
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:39,959
bud it will give you the concept the if
statement and that you'll be able to go

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,039
make some programs using the if
statement and get used to it so that you

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,640
can move on to the next tutorials

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,509
so is going to get started with a
console

15
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:54,780
dot right mind what is

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,049
your name now or gonna do

17
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:02,409
is we're going to declare Street so used
to did he were to let

18
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:05,989
Visual Basic know that we're going to
make a very able so

19
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:10,079
will DM username as

20
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,798
string and we'll set it equal to cart so

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,640
dot read line now or gonna do

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,640
is really do console

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,069
da right line which can ask them for
their password

24
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,078
so white is your

25
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:35,289
password in will declare another
variable

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,850
and it'll be password so damn password

27
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,780
as a string we're going to equal to

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,310
consul dot redline

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,659
soldiers getting whatever the user type
did so now we're gonna create

30
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,130
are if statement so to start off in a
statement using use the keyword

31
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:01,649
yes wheat added it's going to highlight
it blew its gonna showed up in

32
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:02,519
intellisense

33
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,868
now the the definition for the if
statement this is

34
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:13,250
conditionally conditionally excuse a
group statements depending on the value

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,139
of an expression

36
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,559
so basically what that says is is a
certain

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,310
I condition is true the go ahead and do
whatever is inside this

38
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,479
if statement so is username

39
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,659
equals same did what we wanted to do

40
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,870
and if you press enter you can see there
are automatically add

41
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,120
in if for you olives Davis have in

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,159
within in if or else you'll get a syntax
error

43
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,489
so do if using a pic of sam

44
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,099
then consul dot right

45
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:54,098
line welcome Sam

46
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:00,810
in our dish can you create a second its
statement so if password

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,140
equals the New Boston

48
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,299
did well what we wanted to do

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,020
we will just type consul dot

50
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,880
right line insider there

51
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:22,879
what type you have enter the correct
password

52
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,030
okay so now if we run this you see we
have a little bit of a problem here

53
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,240
so we type what is your name that axiom
what is your password

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,400
the New Boston his era close out right
after we're done with that

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
so which can add a redline right here

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,969
so consul dot read

57
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,240
line its initial deposit program

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,570
and let us see you what we have done so
what is your name

59
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,139
same and what is your password the New
Boston

60
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,029
so because name is equal to Sam

61
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,409
is going to bring out welcome Sam and
because

62
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,060
the new boss in the past so that we have
typed in is equal to

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,650
the New Boston in our code right here
its gonna say

64
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,939
you enter the correct password so

65
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:20,779
let's go ahead and with separate this a
bit here just to make the

66
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,119
over it a little bit more readable so
we'll just

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
write another line which is just give us
a blank line in separate these

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,740
self-awareness again say what is your
name and if I type

69
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,960
said Gerald and say what is a pastor at
had the New Boston

70
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,069
is going to say you have enter the
correct password

71
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,310
but didn't say welcome Sam because
gerald

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,550
is not equal to Sam so username

73
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,879
whatever they have tidied is jailed and
is not able to say I am so it will not

74
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,228
do the coincided here

75
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:57,589
and suit since we typed in the New
Boston as a password

76
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,918
it's going to tell us that we have into
the crack password

77
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,000
and it's also work the other way around
so if we do

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,040
what is your name Sam and say what is
your password

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,229
assay OnLive gaming ivs say welcome Sam
but it won't tell us that we have into

80
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,310
the correct password

81
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,139
so here

82
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,689
is basic example the if statement
they're very fun to use when you first

83
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:25,680
begin programming

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,590
you can do a lot with them a lot more
than that you think you could and I so

85
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:30,329
go ahead

86
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,620
look at this coat over again go ahead
and use a in statements and make some

87
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
programs yourself

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,220
and what you got if there is no doubt go
ahead and move on to the next tutorial
