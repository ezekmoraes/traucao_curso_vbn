00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,580
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,900
on live gamer for the New Boston and its
adjoining

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,000
when we take a look at a for loop

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,449
now loops are a very important part of
programming

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,640
basically when loops do is it will
repeat

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,730
a syriza code or a block of code

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,210
for you a certain amount of times now
with the for loop

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,760
it does that Baku code however many
times you want it to you

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,810
in there are going to be using loops
that will do it based on

10
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:37,808
other things so let's go and get started
we're gonna go ahead and create a very

11
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:38,250
able

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,009
and we'll just call it in one

13
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,369
as integer now we're going to do

14
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:48,659
is we're going to create are for loop so
in sarra

15
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,299
plays in key word for ever going to
specify

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:56,679
int1 every insect in one equal or
something because is it

17
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,829
it with anything yet so now you can
start

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,039
41 and they were going to use the
keyword to

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,750
she's 220 and then you can see that

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,118
it adds and next for us so basically
what this does

21
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,259
is it takes it starts out with for which
tells it that we're going to be making a

22
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:15,709
loop

23
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:19,099
it takes int1 and says equal to 1

24
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:22,679
and it's going to do it from one to 20
so

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,770
the first time around for the it once
you meet your One

26
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,239
it when it comes back up to the top in
one is going to be equal to 2

27
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,969
and in three and then poor and so on and
so forth

28
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,310
so in one is gonna go all the way up to
20

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,340
and then once it hits 20 it'll run deep

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,719
the code the for loop on what time in
the most secret 21

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,658
it's not gonna do the for loop again so
to demonstrate this

32
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,680
hours type: consul da right wine

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,070
int1

34
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,898
is equal to and was gonna go ahead and
use our

35
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,040
inside and we're going to type int

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,109
1 so basically what this does is it says

37
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,300
in one is able to and it takes the
current value it wanted

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,400
because we don't know what were it one
is able to witness can

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,530
to but the variable name there now in a
new console

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,439
died redline and if we run this

41
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,300
you can see that it says

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,480
in was equal to 1 in one single to

43
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,699
it one is equal to 3 and it'll go all
the way down

44
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,649
until it one is equal to 20 now

45
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,800
you can change this number appeared to
do the

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,219
for loop as many times as you want so we
can even do it a hundred times

47
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,859
you can see that has

48
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,790
100 by Jay here it starts off with one

49
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:58,789
it goes all the way up to 100 but here
here's one thing

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,189
that will invalidate are for you and
keep you from running

51
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,609
so if we start out for it in one Eagles
won

52
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,970
in there we go to -1 you can see that

53
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,370
it won't print out anything because
default

54
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,230
for loops workout up one value so since
in one starts at one

55
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,359
whenever cuz whenever hits the next
keyword right here

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,590
gonna send it back up to this poor is
going to add 1281

57
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,848
it says it at one ads want it one in one
is now equal to 2

58
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:34,969
in our through for that goes to -1

59
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:41,969
so stuck in a rut all said I'll you've
learned a little bit about four lives

60
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,299
you can go ahead and make your own for
the and they're very useful

61
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,780
and we're gonna be using them a lot
later on in programming there's a lot of

62
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,199
other lives here milling about you gonna
be learning about

63
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,369
on so far within for each

64
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,810
they were going to learn do until do
while there's year while loops

65
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,938
and and there's a lot of other loops
that a very useful in programming

66
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:07,519
so thanks for watching and stay tuned to
the next tutorial
