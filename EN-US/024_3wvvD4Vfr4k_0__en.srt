00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:05,200
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash on live gamer for the New

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,890
Boston

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:09,070
in this tutorial we'll be taking a look
at the

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:14,469
Select Case statement now this like a
safe statement is very similar to the

5
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:19,009
if statement but sometimes you need to
use a slight case instead

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,630
if because it's a lot more efficient and
arts wat

7
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,919
this to you as we start programming so
it's going to get started

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,519
we're gonna create a variable and we'll
call it my int

9
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,289
and we're just going to make any integer
it's now Roy

10
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:40,070
what we're gonna do is work going to you
get the integer from the user

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,289
such as ask them for an integer

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,769
please

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,770
inter integer nodes can get with the
typing

14
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,929
and now we're going to do is we're going
to create Arcelik

15
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,769
Select Case statement so you start off
by typing select it says

16
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:09,700
runs one of several groups statements
depending on the value of an expression

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,750
so actor select where type

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,959
case there says the same thing

19
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,679
in our unity is we're going to type in
our variable that we can use for the

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,618
Select Case

21
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:24,899
statement so in our case we can use my
int

22
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,390
any Zune Press inter iMac the ads

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,069
and select for you so what it's like a
statement does

24
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:36,700
is that it starts off by checking the
first case

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,289
so let's just do case 0 console dot
right line

26
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,859
hello

27
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:48,189
in with you case

28
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:52,509
wide agency there that whenever you
create a case

29
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,200
you go into start by using the keyword
case

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,109
you can add whichever whatever you want
it to be so

31
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,149
in our case raising it suggests over the
integers equal to 0 thing I do this

32
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,159
and you can do this industry surveys
showing

33
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,989
is equal to this story here go ahead and
do whatever's in here

34
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,930
now as I saying I can in a row to myself
there

35
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,069
by with us like a statement the reason
it's more efficient than an if statement

36
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:25,289
is that ill go through and the start

37
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:28,709
it's like a statement in a case 0 is
true

38
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,989
in its gonna go ahead and in this led
k-state for you

39
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,890
diving it take a look at any other cases
you have see could have hundreds and

40
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,018
hundreds of cases

41
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,269
but as soon as it reaches the the one
case is looking for

42
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:43,700
you know exit your select k-state me now
if you use

43
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,958
if and else here then is going to

44
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,408
even though or excuse because it's going
to look at all the ALCS

45
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:53,429
and that's a reason you do when you
select case

46
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,069
over if Chelsea so

47
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:04,068
with us to case one will add a couple
more cases here

48
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,939
okay so now that we have three cases
we're gonna go ahead and run our program

49
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,909
yeah let's not forget to do cancelled
out remind so it's Rustin put something

50
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,530
for the program closes

51
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,640
and if we run this

52
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,199
it'll say please enter an integer

53
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,699
sofa type: 0 is gonna say hello

54
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:47,149
and will run this a couple more times
and go through each case

55
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,170
if we type 1 you know say bye and then

56
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,829
if we typed to you ill say good morning

57
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,260
so a site case statement

58
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,229
is fairly simple its quite similar to
the

59
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:06,429
else here and what you know that down

60
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,810
go ahead and move on to the next 20 and
we're gonna be learning more about us

61
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,289
like case and thanks for watching
