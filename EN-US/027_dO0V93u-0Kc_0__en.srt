00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,419
hello youtube same here from you to dot
com slash on live gamer

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:09,370
for the New Boston and in this tutorial
we'll be taking a look at

3
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:13,779
step operators now the last tutorial we
did a simple for loop

4
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:17,460
and in that for the loop it
automatically

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,330
stepped it up by one each time the for
loop ran now

6
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,669
sometimes you won't want to do that
maybe you want to step it by

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,900
by or step by even 100

8
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,558
there's an easy way to do this by using
what's called the step operator

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,988
and you can also step negative numbers
to says go ahead and create a little

10
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:38,339
demo application for this

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,370
going up to new project

12
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:46,308
were consul application and we will
discard

13
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:51,229
step operator and we'll just go ahead
and click

14
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:58,229
okay that's two men to be here

15
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,549
okay sources add console dot

16
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,600
redline so waits for us to press ENTER
or closer to the program

17
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,618
for it to em close the window before

18
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,859
I'm we're done reading so I'm let's go
ahead and create

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:21,509
a for the sewing 24 no more I'm

20
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,329
equals 1 to 20 and it was to console
doubt right line

21
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:32,969
no one now into making a for loop

22
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,609
you don't have to declare the variable
name one I know I did and my last

23
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:37,159
tutorial

24
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,250
but it isn't necessary you can if you
want to you

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,420
a case and I we got this

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,689
for the done as go ahead and you consul
dot right line appear

27
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,129
normal for you

28
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:56,609
and let's create

29
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,590
another for the so for now I'm one

30
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,569
Eagles won 220 and then let's just do
cancelled outright line

31
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,679
no

32
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,759
one now these are exactly the same

33
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:17,039
but we can do something very simple to
make and completely different so for no

34
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,620
more niggas 12 20

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,090
and we just call the step operator
incest specifies how much to implement

36
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,969
between each loop iteration

37
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:28,359
so that basically says whenever he gets
down to the next

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,180
you whatever is after stat is going to
be how much it adds to

39
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,550
now I'm one so it's go ahead and let's
step

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,180
5 in this for the so

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,879
less come up here intact cancelled I
right line

42
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,810
and then we'll do another one just saw
it at the space

43
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:53,810
in between are four leaves and what to
say step by

44
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,670
5 us create one more for them

45
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:06,158
to console dot right line don't do that
one more time

46
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,019
but in this on to say step

47
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,020
by negative 4

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,270
says create one more for the

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,990
so for now I'm one equals 20

50
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,330
to 1 and with this step that

51
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,830
by negative for so what this is gonna do
is gonna start for the past 20

52
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,130
and go down for each time into it gets
21

53
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,810
and wish to console dot right line

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,830
no one

55
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,400
says go and run a program

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,240
and see what happens okay so appear

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,920
we have are normal for loop which starts
at one

58
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,780
and goes all the way tony An cast by one
each time in Frisco down a bit

59
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,860
we have our step by by starts out at one

60
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,420
at five to which Q g6 then gives you 11

61
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,799
in is the 16 they can see it in pre
anything else after sixteen

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,980
and the reason it does is because if you
at 5:16 is gonna be 21

63
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:18,980
nashnamie out at the balance the loop
that we set and here's our step by -4

64
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,250
it starts out to any two tracks for from
it which is

65
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,259
which makes 16 niggers and 12 than a

66
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,569
then for and it doesn't go down easier
because once again

67
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:35,449
that would be at the balance that we
separate the loop now step

68
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,650
is a very simple thing to learn and it's
very useful though

69
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,899
and I find myself using a lot when I
make programs as so go ahead

70
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,698
and give it a try make some programs are
the and then once you get that down

71
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,270
go ahead and move on to the next
tutorial so thanks for watching
